Issue - The dev deployment shows the return part for Stripe as https://app-test.eventyay.com/tickets/_stripe/oauth_return/ instead of https://app-test.eventyay.com/tickets/_stripe/webhook/. Clarify why the return paths are different on the dev and production deployment.

OAuth Return URL
This is used when you connect a Stripe account to your platform via Stripe Connect (OAuth).
After the user authenticates and grants permissions to your app, Stripe redirects them to your specified OAuth return URI.
In your dev deployment, this is:
https://app-test.eventyay.com/tickets/_stripe/oauth_return/
This path is used to handle the result of the OAuth flow (success or error).

Webhook Endpoint
This is where Stripe sends event notifications (like payment succeeded, refund issued, etc.).
In your case, the correct webhook endpoint would be:
https://app-test.eventyay.com/tickets/_stripe/webhook/
Application listens here for Stripe's server-to-server POST requests and processes them accordingly.

They serve completely different purposes.
The oauth_return URL is for redirects during user interaction, while the webhook URL is for asynchronous server notifications from Stripe.

On dev vs. production:
It's possible dev and prod environments have slightly different setups or that one is misconfigured.
Check your Stripe dashboard (for the dev API keys) under:
Developers > Webhooks — to confirm webhook endpoint is set correctly.
Connect settings — to verify the correct OAuth return URI is listed.
