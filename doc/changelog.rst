Release Notes
=============

- :release:`1.1.2 <2020-01-10>`
- :bug:`-` If a CfP requested the submitters' availability at submission time, only logged-in users could successfully finish the submission workflow.
- :release:`1.1.1 <2020-01-10>`
- :bug:`844` The 1.1.0 release was only installable via git (either by way of pip URLs or a full checkout), not by pip on its own.
- :bug:`-` The list of all submission feedback given in a single event was only usable for people with administrator permissions.
- :bug:`-` Not all CfP form help text parts were translated.
- :release:`1.1.0 <2019-12-21>`
- :feature:`-` pretalx now comes with an update check, which will notify you when new pretalx or plugin versions are available. This check sends anonymous data to the pretalx.com server, which is run by the pretalx developer. The data consist of a random but stable ID, the number of total and public events, and the version of pretalx and all installed plugins. No identifying information will be retained, and there is a visible and persistent opt-out warning until acknowledged by an administrator.
- :bug:`-` One broken task among the periodically executed task would prevent others from being executed.
- :bug:`828` Deleted talks could still be shown with their previous title and speaker. Now they are always replaced with a box saying "[deleted]" with no further information.
- :bug:`816` Reducing the slot count of a submission where all slots had been scheduled would not remove spare slots.
- :feature:`-` Plugins can now add content to the top of the user profile pages and the user-private submission lists.
- :feature:`841` File attachments generated from user data are now generated to be in safe ASCII range, to avoid trouble with unicode-sensitive gunicorn versions.
- :feature:`794` There is now a page that shows all feedback by attendees for any talk in the conference.
- :feature:`432` Organisers can now send emails to all speakers who have not uploaded slides/files for their talk yet.
- :feature:`-` pretalx now has pretty error pages for CSRF fails and 400 errors. Test error pages are located at ``/400``, ``/403``, ``/404``, ``/500``, and ``/403/csrf``.
- :feature:`792` There is now a CSV export for answered questions.
- :feature:`814` Questions of the type "choose one from a list" are now shown as a list of radio input options instead of a single dropdown, if there are three or less options to choose from.
- :feature:`-` Plugins can now implement the ``uninstalled`` method to perform actions when a user deactivates them for an event.
- :support:`-` We documented the implicit requirement that the filesystem pretalx accesses should work with non-ASCII file names. Please check the installation documentation if you want to make sure this is the case for you.
- :feature:`-` The submission type list and the track list now list the numbers of submissions per entry.
- :feature:`638` You can now determine if the answers to talk questions should be visible to reviewers. This allows you to ask personal questions of your submitters, even when you are running an anonymous review process.
- :feature:`648` pretalx now comes with a CfP editor that allows you to change the headline, text, and help texts on each of the CfP step pages.
- :feature:`760` Speakers can now see and reset their API token in their profile page.
- :support:`-` We have added a couple of pages to the pretalx wiki on GitHub, most importantly a list of events using pretalx, and a list of available plugins. The wiki is world-writable, so please add to it if you have an event or plugin that hasn't been mentioned yet!
- :feature:`277` The static HTML export will now be triggered when talk or speaker data is changed (as long as it's also generated on schedule release). To protect against high server load, it will still run at most once every hour.
- :feature:`-` To reduce scroll wheel abrasions, pretalx schedules are now tabbed with one tab per event day.
- :feature:`-` You can now embed a widget of the pretalx schedule on your own pages. You can generate the HTML necessary for the widget in your event settings.
- :feature:`242` pretalx has learned what breaks are. Organisers can create those in the schedule editor, and they will be shown in an appropriately muted way in the schedule.
- :feature:`324` Organisers can create access tokens that allow users to submit after the CfP deadline, or that give access to hidden tracks or submission types.
- :feature:`-` pretalx has the new management command ``create_test_event``, which creates a demo event in a stage of your choice (``cfp``, ``review``, ``schedule`` or ``over``). All user accounts are created with ``@example.org`` email addresses.
- :feature:`-` If you want to display your schedule on your own homepage, pretalx now offers you a schedule widget. You can generate the code for the widget in your organiser settings.
- :feature:`-` For events that span multiple days, pretalx now shows the conference days in a tabbed display, instead of requiring you to scroll a lot.
- :feature:`-` If pretalx encounters an error it can't recover from, the error page now shows a link to a partially pre-filled GitHub issue.
- :bug:`-` pretalx would show an error when users were asked to select their submission's track during the CfP workflow.
- :release:`1.0.4 <2019-10-15>`
- :bug:`-` In feedback pages for talks that contained multiple speakers, the email addresses of those speakers were shown next to their names.
- :feature:`-` Allow users to add an imprint URL that will be shown at the bottom of every public event page.
- :bug:`-` On the sneak peek preview page, markdown wasn't rendered correctly to HTML.
- :feature:`-` If pretalx is running in development mode, its favicon will be red.
- :feature:`-` Plugin authors will now have access to all configuration sections starting with ``[plugin:*]``, to ease the integration of system level settings.
- :feature:`787` Provide the file uploads a speaker added to their submission via the ``/talks`` and ``/submissions`` API endpoint.
- :feature:`-` Show speakers how many feedback notes have been left (if any) in their personal submission list view.
- :feature:`-` Answers to boolean questions are not displayed as "yes", "no", and "maybe" in public display, instead of "true" or "false".
- :bug:`775` When a speaker withdrew their already-accepted talk, the talk slot was not removed from the schedule editor. It did work when setting the state via the organiser interface.
- :bug:`774` The API endpoint for events always returned a 404 on the detail view, even when event was visible in the list view.
- :feature:`-` Speaker and talk detail pages now contain links to their respective API detail pages as alternate links.
- :feature:`-` The main schedule page now returns a 303 See Also redirect if accessed with JSON or XML accept headers.
- :bug:`773` In the ``/talks`` and ``/submissions`` endpoints, speaker biographies were not exposed. They were available in the ``/speakers`` endpoint as expected, so if you cannot currently upgrade, please be advised to use that endpoint.
- :feature:`-` Organisers can now disable/remove the profile picture input field if they don't want any speaker pictures at all.
- :feature:`-` The event creation assistant now suggests more sensible event slugs.
- :feature:`-` The time(s), date(s) and location(s) of scheduled talks were added to the private speaker pages of those talks, making it easier for speakers to find out when and where their talk is taking place.
- :feature:`-` The API is now also available as an HTML browsable API. Filters and searches should be working as well as just browsing around.
- :feature:`-` The events API endpoint now comes with a ``urls`` field exposing links to the schedule page, and the login page, among other things.
- :bug:`754` Reviews could be returned multiple times in the reviews API endpoint (though the total count returned was correct).
- :feature:`742` Organisers can now set a minimum or maximum length for submission titles.
- :feature:`743` If no schedule has been published but a sneak peek is available, the schedule page now redirects to the sneak peek page.
- :feature:`-` The pretalx markdown display now supports markdown tables.
- :feature:`-` Due to the powerful and hard-to-specify nature of the schedule HTML import, the frontend facing schedule xml import has been removed. Administrators can still import schedule files with the ``import_schedule`` command.
- :release:`1.0.3 <2019-06-27>`
- :bug:`730` The talk page of talks with multiple slots did not work and threw an error instead.
- :bug:`729` The “unscheduled talks” column in the schedule editor could overlap with the room columns on events with many rooms.
- :bug:`728` The “Invite reviewers” link on the main event dashboard led to an incorrect page.
- :feature:`732` Speaker availability is now included in the API for organizers.
- :feature:`475` Organisers can now regenerate the accept/reject emails from the review dashboard context menu.
- :support:`-` To keep in line with our new database scoping, if you access the pretalx shell, you are now advised to use the ``shell_scoped`` command instead of the ``shell`` command, and call it with the flags for your event, like ``--event__slug=myevent`` (or an ``--override`` flag to access all events).
- :feature:`731` Users can now see (and potentially edit) their submission's submission type.
- :bug:`-` Some custom domains could not be set via the frontend.
- :feature:`-` Organisers can now also see unconfirmed talks in their preview of the public schedule page. The unconfirmed talks are clearly marked to avoid confusion.
- :release:`1.0.2 <2019-06-07>`
- :bug:`-` Organisers were able to see all emails sent to a user in their events, instead of only emails sent for the currently active event. This is a data leak. You can find more information `on our blog <https://pretalx.com/p/news/incident-report-data-leak-in-pretalx-10/>`_.
- :feature:`-` We now add a hash to all uploaded file names to avoid collisions.
- :release:`1.0.1 <2019-06-03>`
- :bug:`719` In the submission process, file upload questions would not be saved correctly.
- :bug:`713` The sneak peek toggle in the submission list did not actually work due to a changed URL.
- :bug:`718` Regular installation from PyPI was broken due to an incorrect file reference.
- :release:`1.0.0 <2019-06-02>`
- :feature:`427` Organisers can now permit users to submit (and change) their own talk duration length.
- :feature:`700` Submitters can now choose to withdraw their talk even if it was accepted. When an accepted talk is withdrawn, the organisers will receive a notification email.
- :feature:`-` When using a command line client to access a schedule page, pretalx will now output ASCII tables or lists, depending on the format parameter.
- :feature:`402` Fields with markdown support now come with a preview next to the input field (if JavaScript is enabled).
- :feature:`669` Emails can now also be sent grouped by submission track or submission type.
- :support:`-` You can now install ``pretalx[redis]`` if you use pretalx with a redis server for better caching and/or asynchronous task runners.
- :support:`-` Our documentation now lists the tasks a pretalx instance should run periodically, namely ``runperiodic`` about once every five minutes, and ``clearsessions`` about once a month.
- :feature:`-` Administrators can now see a dashboard with relevant settings and current information, including documentation links.
- :bug:`689` In the (undocumented) review API, reviews of deleted submissions were shown, even though those submissions were not available anymore via the frontend.
- :bug:`688` pretalx was inconstent in its usage of email senders and reply-tos. Now, if there is a sender address configured, the reply-to is not explicitly set. pretalx falls back to the instance-global sender if there is no event sender address. A reply-to setting is available if the organisers wish to provide a separate address there.
- :feature:`682` The submission endpoint now provides a ``created`` field to organiser users.
- :feature:`326` During event creation, pretalx provides more critical feedback, such as asking if the event is supposed to take place in the past, or suggesting good slugs.
- :feature:`393` As an alternative to file uploads, organisers can now also provide their custom CSS directly as text.
- :feature:`360` Within the review dashboard, organisers can now accept and reject multiple submissions at the same time.
- :feature:`656` Instead of by average, review scores are now shown aggregated by the median.
- :bug:`655` Mails to submissions with titles near the length cap (of 200 characters) could not be created, since with the added "[event]" prefix the mail subject was too long to be saved.
- :feature:`-` Question pages now feature visual statistics where appropriate.
- :feature:`-` There now is a page for submission statistics.
- :feature:`628` Prefill CfP form with track and submission type if they are available in the query string.
- :support:`-` pretalx is now able to run with Python 3.7 even when using Celery.
- :feature:`598` Via the new review phase settings, speakers can be allowed to modify their submissions while they are being reviewed.
- :feature:`641` At the undocumented URL `/<event>/speaker/by-id/123/` there is now a redirect to the canonical speaker URL `/<event>/speaker/CODE/` to work around export format restrictions.
- :bug:`565` When using the back button to return to the previous step in the submission workflow, the data from the current step had to be filled in to use the button, but was not saved. Now it will be saved, and the progress bar on top can be used for lossy (but quick) navigation to the previous step.
- :bug:`645` The rendering of the full submission content in the acknowledgment mail (upon submission) looked weird in HTML, due to missing line breaks.
- :bug:`646` On slow network connections, the login step of the CfP submission loaded in a suboptimal way, leaving users with a seemingly finished page but without the login/registration form. As a consequence, all page loads (but especially that one) were optimized.
- :bug:`642` Having only one submission type in the event showed a drop-down with submission types from ALL events, instead of hiding the submission type input completely as intended.
- :feature:`609` Organisers can now filter submissions and reviews by track.
- :feature:`634` The API now provides internal notes by speakers and organisers to requesting users with adequate permissions.
- :feature:`-` Organizers can now provide a header image instead of a header color and pattern for their events.
- :feature:`640` Instead of having to scroll with the mouse wheel or arrow keys when dragging a talk in the schedule editor, you can now just drag the talk to the upper or lower edge of the window instead.
- :feature:`-` In pretalx, emails the organisers send out are now connected with user accounts if the address matches anybody, allowing organisers and speakers to see which emails were sent to a speaker. This serves both as a help for organisers and speakers, in case emails get lost, email addresses are inaccessible, or any other issues occur.
- :feature:`637` pretalx will now display the schedule wider the more rooms are present, starting at four rooms and reaching maximum browser width for six rooms, to make schedules look less cramped and more readable.
- :feature:`620` Speakers can't invite other speakers any longer after the CfP is over.
- :support:`606` Our documentation now explains which parts of pretalx to back up.
- :feature:`486` In the schedule editor, the room names and the current date are now fixed to the top when scrolling down.
- :bug:`618` Fix a bug where some fields in the schedule.xml export were rendered without their timezone offset (only day defintions, not the talk times).
- :feature:`532` Add a field for notes of the organisers for their own use which is not visible to the public and the speakers.
- :feature:`-` Reviewers are now shown a progress bar when going through submissions.
- :feature:`570` Submissions can now be scheduled multiple times, e.g. if a workshop will be held twice.
- :bug:`-` Changing the order of rooms made the schedule break.
- :feature:`433` Organisers can now view all reviews, except for their own submissions.
- :feature:`589` Before setting a new custom domain for an event, pretalx now checks if the domain has any nameserver records.
- :bug:`-` A dependency of ours introduced an XSS vulnerability, which organisers could use to execute JavaScript during the CfP workflow of speakers via question texts. We have added a fix against this behaviour, and submitted a report including a patch to the upstream library. To prevent issues like this one in the future, we've moved all remaining JavaScript sources to files, and set the according CSP header, so that execution of inline JavaScript will be disabled.
- :feature:`364` Speakers can now invite a co-speaker while in the submission process.
- :feature:`62` Exporters can now opt in to show a QR code to their location. The XML and iCal exporters show a QR code linking their location by default.
- :feature:`477` If you only noticed after releasing your schedule that you wanted to changes something in your speaker notifications, you can now generate those emails again from the schedule editor actions menu.
- :bug:`479` When telling speakers about their scheduled or rescheduled slots, a hidden mail template was used instead of the actual template visible to the organiser.
- :feature:`563` For later reference, the full submission is included in the confirmation mail sent to the speaker.
- :bug:`571` When adding a submission as organiser, pretalx did not validate the speaker email address and then tried to send them an email regardless of its validity.
- :feature:`403` Organisers can now choose question answers by speakers to be published on the talk/speaker pages. This setting cannot be changed on once the question has been answered, to make sure that speakers are informed about this.
- :feature:`-` Reviewer teams can now be restricted to one or multiple tracks. Reviewers will only see submissions and reviews from these tracks.
- :feature:`-` Teams settings are now located exclusively at the organiser level. The navigation entry in the event sidebar will take you there directly.
- :feature:`523` If you use tracks, you can now choose to make questions available only to submissions on certain tracks.
- :feature:`459` The speaker page in the organiser backend now has a direct link to send an email to that speaker.
- :feature:`457` You can now order submissions by the number of reviews they have received on the review page.
- :feature:`566` The Reply-To field now permits multiple email addresses.
- :bug:`579` When organisers changed the event timeframe, already submitted availabilites would have to be changed upon new submission.
- :feature:`577` You can now decide if text lengths should be counted in words or in characters when restricting how long they should be.
- :bug:`587` pretalx did not automtically update a talk's duration when it was changed via the submission type or directly. It was only changed when you moved the talk in the schedule editor.
- :bug:`594` pretalx did not display speaker availabilities during submission, even when they were required, breaking submission workflows.
- :feature:`346` Due to the generous sponsorship of JuliaCon, pretalx is now capable of blind reviews, i.e. making sure that reviewers cannot see speaker names.
- :feature:`-` The organiser area has now additional, event specific login pages (at ``/orga/event/<slug>/login/``) which redirect by default to the event dashboard, and appear with the color and logo of the event in question.
- :feature:`-` The review settings have moved from the CfP page to their own settings page.
- :feature:`-` You can now decide to add the ``robots=noindex`` meta tag to prevent bots from crawling your event pages.
- :feature:`-` Plugin developers can now use the ``is_available`` hook to decide if their plugin should be shown on a per-event basis.
- :bug:`-` Speaker without an avatar and with gravatar disabled had a broken avatar-image in the speaker's view in the orga-backend.
- :bug:`-` The visual representation of a speaker's avatar is now consistent across all image-sizes and bio-texts.
- :bug:`583` When signing up with an email address with upper case letters included, pretalx only allowed to log in with a lower-cased email address.
- :bug:`572` People who had only deleted submissions in an event were still shown in the submitter list, which was unexpected and was since fixed.
- :feature:`-` If only one conference language is available, pretalx doesn't as speakers to choose it from a drop-down, as this behaviour is rather silly.
- :support:`-` pretalx doesn't run ``regenerate_css`` on startup automatically any longer. This reduces startup times. If for any reason an event does not look as it should, you can fix it by running ``python -m pretalx regenerate_css``. You will also need to execute this command on updates from now on.
- :feature:`-` You can now decide if you want to notify speakers about their changed talks when releasing a new schedule.
- :support:`-` To help make other pretalx installations more secure, we've updated our proposed nginx configuration to include an attachment header for all files under /media, to prevent user uploaded data to be delivered directly to other users. If you host a pretalx instance, please make use of this option.
- :feature:`-` Since SVG files are nearly impossible to sanitize, pretalx has given up trying, and will no longer accept SVG files as image uploads.
- :bug:`-` The iCal export for speakers who had both scheduled and not-yet-scheduled talks was broken.
- :feature:`559` Organisers can download a list of speakers as a CSV file.
- :support:`-` A couple of URLs now end in a trailing slash where they did not before – you will be automatically redirected, so you don't have to worry about it unless you integrate pretalx somewhere without following redirects.
- :feature:`-` You can set the URL of your static HTML export, if you're using one, and it will be used when generating absolute URLs, e.g. in exports or emails.
- :release:`0.9.0 <2018-12-21>`
- :feature:`-` pretalx can now group talks in tracks. Each talk can be assigned a track (either by the submitter, or by the organiser). Tracks will be displayed in configurable colors in the public schedule. The feature is entirely optional, and you can continue using pretalx without tracks without any problem.
- :feature:`-` We tuned pretalx performance to be faster when showing the schedules of large conferences with several hundreds of talks.
- :feature:`538` The sneak peek view will only feature talks that have been accepted.
- :feature:`440` Organisers can now follow an RSS feed to see new submissions – you'll have to provide your authentication token in the RSS request header to authenticate.
- :feature:`-` You can now set the default pretalx system wide time zone and locale (defaulting to ``UTC`` and ``en``).
- :bug:`544` Organisers could see the titles of speaker information notes of all events, not just the currently active one (they could not see the details or edit them).
- :feature:`504` The schedule page is now better printable.
- :bug:`-` A `bug <https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/4878>` in celery could make running pretalx with asynchronous workers impossible. We've pinned an earlier celery version that doesn't show this problem.
- :support:`-` A new pretalx plugin adds media.ccc.de as a recording provider – this plugin replaces the previously inbuilt capacity of pretalx to provide recording iframes. (This functionality was never directly exposed and only accessible via the pretalx shell. It is now deprecated and will be removed in a later version.)
- :feature:`-` Plugins can now provide recording iframes (via the new ``register_recording_provider`` signal and other mixins).
- :feature:`-` The new ``nav_event_settings`` plugin signal allows plugins to integrate their own settings pages next to the pretalx core pages.
- :feature:`-` pretalx now presents a colorpicker for your event primary color, including a hint on color suitability.
- :feature:`-` The new `/api/me` endpoint shows name, email address, locale, and timezone of the logged in user.
- :feature:`-` The ``nav_event`` plugin signal has changed to expect a list instead of a dictionary response. The dictionary response will be supported for one more version, and raises a deprecation warning.
- :feature:`-` The API now provides a ``/rooms`` endpoint.
- :feature:`530` The API now provides a ``/reviews`` endpoint.
- :bug:`529` When trying to review their own submission, a user would see a 404 not found error instead of an explanation that this was a forbidden action.
- :bug:`-` The password reset form told users if they had already tried to reset their password in the last 24 hours. While this is helpful, it also allows user discovery via password reset. Instead, the user now sees a more generic message.
- :feature:`-` While filling out the submission form wizard, submitters see a top bar telling them where they are in the submission process.
- :bug:`-` The event dashboard showed a wrong countdown towards the CfP end while the CfP end was between three and one day away.
- :feature:`-` The new event dropdown helps you find your event, even if you have access to many events.
- :bug:`-` The organiser login page did not strip whitespace from login credentials.
- :bug:`524` Review settings contained the setting "Force data entry" twice, referring to the score and text, respectively.
- :bug:`522` If a speaker did not check a mandatory checkbox, they could not submit the form (as intended), but could see no feedback explaining the issue.
- :feature:`` The ``rebuild`` command now comes with a lot more build output for ease of debugging. You can disable the build output with the new ``--silent/-s`` flag.
- :feature:`476` Administrators can now delete both events and organisers.
- :feature:`493` Speaker email addresses are now available via the API for users with access permissions.
- :bug:`515` Under rare circumstances, the pretalx database could reach a state pretalx couldn't cope with due to duplicate schedule versions.
- :feature:`512` You can now configure if speakers should provide their availability during talk submission.
- :support:`-` Due to an updated Django version, pretalx has dropped support for PostgreSQL 9.3 and MySQL 5.5.
- :release:`0.8.0 <2018-09-23>`
- :bug:`-` When a user removed a submission containing an answered choice question, pretalx removed the selected answer option, too.
- :bug:`501` When a speaker held more than two talks, their related talks did not show up.
- :bug:`505` Custom CSS may now also include media queries.
- :bug:`500` Display of times could be off in the static HTML export.
- :support:`-` The URLs for schedule exports have changed from /myevent/schedule/export?exporter=exportername to /myevent/schedule/export/exportername – if you have hardcoded links to schedule exporters, please update them accordingly.
- :feature:`213` A human-readable time until the CfP closes now shows up next to the end time.
- :bug:`503` Not all current TLDs did end up included as URLs when processing markdown input to build links.
- :bug:`-` The schedule import in the organiser backend never worked (while the manage command for administrators did work).
- :feature:`454` As an organizer, it's now possible to send an email to all reviewers in the Compose Mail section.
- :feature:`492` In exports, HTTP Etags are now supported to allow for more aggressive caching on clients.
- :bug:`-` If a review question was mandatory while submission questions were active, they would block the submission process.
- :feature:`-` Organisers can now also reset the password for the speakers they have access to.
- :bug:`488` The HTML export contained media files (not other content) from all conferences on an instance, instead of the exported conference.
- :feature:`-` Present a public list of talks and a list of speakers.
- :bug:`478` The behaviour of pressing enter in multi-step forms was unintuitive in some places.
- :feature:`-` The submission list now includes a graph of submissions over time.
- :feature:`-` You can now see the sneak peek / is_featured flag in the submissions and talk API endpoints.
- :feature:`-` You can now use your authentication token to access all pages you have access to, as you already could for the API. This makes integration of exports much easier.
- :support:`-` All manage commands available in pretalx are now included in the documentation.
- :feature:`240` When using paper cards to build a schedule, each card comes with a QR code link to a quick scheduling form for that submission.
- :feature:`-` You can now see warnings and what the public changelog will look like before releasing a new schedule.
- :feature:`214` The schedule editor shows warnings on scheduling conflicts, including live feedback on where you can schedule a talk.
- :feature:`474` The review dashboard now features the same search and filter options as the submission list.
- :bug:`473` Following the revamp of team permissions, override votes were missing from the settings. We re-introduced the settings, and improved the general handling of override votes.
- :support:`-` pretalx now doesn't support usernames any longer – as all users had to have email addresses already, you will now have to provide an email address to log in. This may confuse users – as an administrator, you can look up users' email addresses if they don't remember them, or change them, if necessary.
- :bug:`-` You could make questions inactive, but not delete them.
- :feature:`408` You can now add length restrictions to abstracts, descriptions, speaker biographies, and all text-based questions.
- :feature:`-` When linking to a talk on social media, those pages will show the talk image.
- :feature:`-` French translation
- :feature:`-` The event logo shows up larger and up to the full width of the document below. Please check that your event still looks as intended after upgrading.
- :feature:`149` Allow to order rooms manually.
- :feature:`149` Allow to order questions manually.
- :support:`-` We now have tests to make sure all config options and plugin hooks are part of our documentation.
- :feature:`-` Instead of setting a flag somewhere, pretalx now has an explicit "go live" button. Plugins can listen to the corresponding signal (please refer to the plugin documentation for further information).
- :bug:`463` Don't show a 404 error if a reviewer tries to review their own submission, but show an error message instead.
- :feature:`-` For organisers, the submission/talk API endpoints now contain the question answers given by the speakers.
- :feature:`-` Schedules now contain a search bar to filter talks by title or speaker.
- :feature:`-` Schedules now feature a sidebar navigation to jump directly to a selected day.
- :feature:`-` Allow organisers to configure which of the default CfP fields to request and require. Please check your settings after updating, as the migration is not guaranteed to work as expected.
- :feature:`-` Prevent organisers from adding a non-localhost mail server without transport level security to make sure our Privacy Policy holds true.
- :feature:`415` Allow organisers to trigger a password reset for team members.
- :bug:`451` Don't crash during ``pretalx init`` if no conference organiser slug is present.
- :release:`0.7.1 <2018-06-19>`
- :bug:`-` The new read-only links for submissions received the same secret token when migrating the database. pretalx leaked no data, as this made using the read-only links impossible. When upgrading to the next release, all read-only link addresses will be reset.
- :bug:`-` A one-character-oversight led to issues with the new navigation search with certain user permissions.
