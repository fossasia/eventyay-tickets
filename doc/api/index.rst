API documentation
=================

pretalx currently contains a REST-style API.  This API is not yet considered
stable, so please tread carefully, and don't be surprised at API changes (which
will be noted in our changelog).

Currently, the API provides read-only capabilities, but it will be extended in
functionality over time.
