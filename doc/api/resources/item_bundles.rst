Item bundles
============

Resource description
--------------------

With bundles, you can specify products that are included within other products. There are two premier use cases of this:

* Package discounts. For example, you could offer a discounted package that includes three tickets but can only be
  bought as a whole. With a bundle including three times the usual product, the package will automatically pull three
  sub-items into the cart, making sure of correct quota calculation and issuance of the correct number of tickets.

* Tax splitting. For example, if your conference ticket includes a part that is subject to different taxation and that
  you need to put on the invoice separately. When you putting a "designated price" on a bundled sub-item, pretix will
  use that price to show a split taxation.

The bundles resource contains the following public fields:

count                                 integer                    Number of items included
designated_price                      money (string)             Designated price of the bundled product. This will be

                                                                 taxation. This is not added to the price.
