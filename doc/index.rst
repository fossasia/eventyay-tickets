Welcome to pretalx!
===================

pretalx is an open source conference management tool – it allows you to create Calls for
Participation, customize them, read and review submissions, choose your conference's talks, schedule
them (on the days and in as rooms you need), and release versioned schedules. And it can do even
more – check the :doc:`features </features>` page for details.

Project status
--------------

`pretalx` is still work in progress – you can check the available features on our :doc:`features
</features>` page, which also lists future milestones.

pretalx supports everything you need to set up a CfP and talk submissions, scheduling, and
communications with your speakers. We test every new feature, and we use it in production for one of
our events.  If some feature is of specific interest to you, you can track its current status in the
issues_ of the pretalx repository.

Documentation structure
-----------------------

As often the case with new projects, pretalx documentation is still limited. In the future, we're
aiming to have **User documentation** showing how to use pretalx, **Administrator documentation**
detailing setup and maintenance procedures, as well as **Developer documentation** for budding
pretalx contributors.

Since documentation is a lot of work on a fast-changing project, we limit our documentation to
showing how to set up pretalx, both for developers and for admins:

Administrator docs

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   install/index
