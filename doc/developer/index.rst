Developer documentation
=======================

You want to contribute? That's great, we love contributions! Being an open
source project, pretalx will thrive if it receives regular contributions from
the community. Everyone is able to contribute, and contributions come in many
forms: Code, Documentation, Translations, Graphics, Feedback ….
We appreciate them highly!

This part of the documentation tries to give you some information that you
might need on the way.  But don't worry if you still get stuck: It's probably
not you, it's us. This documentation is probably incomplete.  So do not
hesitate to send us questions -- and afterwards, contribute to the
documentation to help the next one who is running into the same problem. 😉
