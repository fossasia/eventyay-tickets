<p>This page gives definitions of domain-specific terms that we use a lot inside eventyay and that might be used slightly
differently elsewhere, as well as their official translations to other languages. In some cases, things have a different
name internally, which is noted with a 🔧 symbol. If you only use eventyay, you’ll never see these, but if you’re
going to develop around eventyay, for example connect to eventyay through our API, you need to know these as well.</p>

<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Organizer</strong></div>
<div class="line">🇩🇪 Veranstalter</div>
</div>
</td>
<td><p>An organizer represents the entity using eventyay, usually the company or institution running one or multiple events.
In terms of navigation in the system, organizers are the “middle layer” between the system itself and the specific
events.
Multiple organizers on the same eventyay system are fully separated from each other with very few exceptions.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Event</strong></div>
<div class="line">🇩🇪 Veranstaltung</div>
</div>
</td>
<td><p>An event is the central entity in eventyay that you and your customers interact with all the time. An event
represents one <strong>shop</strong> in which things like tickets can be bought. Since the introduction of event series (see
below), this might include multiple events in the real world.</p>
<p>Every purchase needs to be connected to an event, and most things are completely separate between different
events, i.e. most actions and configurations in eventyay are done per-event.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Event series</strong></div>
<div class="line">🇩🇪 Veranstaltungsreihe</div>
</div>
</td>
<td><p>An event series is one of two types of events. Unlike a non-series event, an event series groups together
multiple real-world events into one eventyay shop. Examples are time-slot-based booking for a museum, a band on
tour, a theater group playing the same play multiple times, etc.</p></td>

<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Date</strong></div>
<div class="line">🇩🇪 Termin</div>
<div class="line">🔧 Subevent</div>
</div>
</td>
<td><p>A date represents a single real-world event inside an event series. Dates can differ from each other in name,
date, time, location, pricing, capacity, and seating plans, but otherwise share the same configuration.</p></td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Admission product</strong></div>
<div class="line">🇩🇪 Zutrittsprodukt</div>
</div>
</td>
<td><p>A product is considered an <strong>admission product</strong> if its purchase represents a person being granted access to your
event. This applies to most ticketing products, but not e.g. to merchandise.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Variation</strong></div>
<div class="line">🇩🇪 Variante</div>
<div class="line">🔧 Item variation</div>
</div>
</td>
<td><p>Some products come in multiple variations that can differ in description, price and capacity. Examples would
include “Adult” and “Child” in case of a concert ticket, or “S”, “M”, “L”, … in case of a t-shirt product.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Category</strong></div>
<div class="line">🇩🇪 Kategorie</div>
</div>
</td>
<td><p>Products can be grouped together in categories. This is mostly to organize them cleanly in the frontend if you
have lots of them.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Quota</strong></div>
<div class="line">🇩🇪 Kontingent</div>
</div>
</td>
<td><p>A quota is a capacity pool that defines how many times a product can be sold. A quota can be connected to multiple
products, in which case all of them are counted together. This is useful e.g. if you have full-price and reduced
tickets and only want to sell a certain number of tickets in total. The same way, multiple quotas can be connected
to the same product, in which case the ticket will be available as long as all of them have capacity left.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Add-on product</strong></div>
<div class="line">🇩🇪 Zusatzprodukt</div>
</div>
</td>
<td><p>An add-on product is a product that is purchased as an upgrade or optional addition to a different product.
Examples would be include a conference ticket that optionally allows to buy a public transport ticket for the
same day, or a family ticket for 4 persons that allows you to add additional persons at a small cost, or a
“two workshops” package that allows you to select two of a larger number of workshops at a discounted price.
In all cases, there is a “main product” (the conference ticket, the family ticket) and a number of “add-on products”
that can be chosen from.</p></td>

<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Bundled product</strong></div>
<div class="line">🇩🇪 Enthaltenes Produkt</div>
</div>
</td>
<td><p>A bundled product is a product that is automatically put into the cart when another product is purchased. It’s
similar to an add-on product, except that the customer has no choice between whether it is added or which of a
set of product is added.</p></td>
</tr>

<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Question</strong></div>

<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Voucher</strong></div>
<div class="line">🇩🇪 Gutschein</div>
</div>
</td>
<td><p>A voucher is a code that can be used for multiple purposes: To grant a discount to specific customers, to only
show certain products to certain customers, or to keep a seat open for someone specific even though you are
sold out. If a voucher is used to apply a discount, the price of the purchased product is reduced by the
discounted amount. Vouchers are connected to a specific event.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Gift card</strong></div>

</div>
</td>
<td><p>A <a class="reference internal" href="events/giftcards.html#giftcards"><span class="std std-ref">gift card</span></a> is a coupon representing an exact amount of money that can be used for purchases
of any kind. Gift cards can be sold, created manually, or used as a method to refund your customer without paying
them back directly.
Unlike a voucher, it does not reduce the price of the purchased products when redeemed, but instead works as a
payment method to lower the amount that needs to be paid through other methods. Gift cards are specific to an
organizer by default but can even by shared between organizers.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Cart</strong></div>

<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Invoice</strong> and <strong>Cancellation</strong></div>
<div class="line">🇩🇪 Rechnung und Rechnungskorrektur</div>
</div>
</td>
<td><p>An invoice refers to a legal document created to document a purchase for tax purposes. Invoices have individual
numbers and no longer change after they have been issued. Every invoice is connected to an order, but an order
can have multiple invoices: If an order changes, a cancellation document is created for the old invoice and a
new invoice is created.</p></td>

<div class="line">🇬🇧 <strong>Check-in list</strong></div>
<div class="line">🇩🇪 Check-in-Liste</div>
</div>
</td>
<td><p>A check-in list is used to configure who can be scanned at a specific entry or exit of the event. Check-in lists
are isolated from each other, so by default each ticket is valid once on every check-in list individually. They
are therefore often used to represent <em>parts</em> of an event, either time-wise (e.g. conference days) or space-wise
(e.g. rooms).</p></td>
