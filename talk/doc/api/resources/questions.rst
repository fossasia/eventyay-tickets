Questions
=========

.. versionadded:: 2.0.0
   This resource endpoint.

Resource description
--------------------

The questions resource represents the highly flexible questions model that allows organisers to request
nearly arbitrary additional information from speakers or reviewers. You will sometimes find questions
nested in other information, such as in answers â€“ in that case, only the ``id`` and ``question`` fields
will be included to reduce the transmission size.

The questions resource contains the following public fields:

Permissions and limitations
---------------------------

This endpoint is writable. However, it does not support the full spectrum of question capabilities, namely:

- You cannot limit a question to tracks or submission types
- You cannot change or create question options (for choice and multiple-choice questions)
- You cannot change the order of questions

.. note::
   These limitations are not by design, they are by capacity.
   If you would like to see these features in pretalx, you can :ref:`contribute <contributing>` them or provide :ref:`funding <funding>`!
