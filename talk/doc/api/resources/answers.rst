   This resource endpoint.

Resource description
--------------------

The answers resource represents all data collected by organisers via the flexible questions model, that
allows for nearly arbitrary data collection from speakers or reviewers. The answers endpoint includes
minimal information on the question answered: just the ID and the question. For further details, please
refer to the ``questions/`` endpoint.

The answers resource contains the following public fields:

Permissions and limitations
---------------------------

This endpoint is writable. However, it does not support the full spectrum of question capabilities, namely:

- You cannot answer or change choice questions
- You cannot answer or change file upload questions
- There is currently no API validation that the answer conforms to the question type, e.g. that number questions are answered with numbers

.. note::
   These limitations are not by design, they are by capacity.
   If you would like to see these features in pretalx, you can :ref:`contribute <contributing>` them or provide :ref:`funding <funding>`!
