Creating custom views
=====================

This page describes how to provide a custom view from within your plugin. Before you start
reading this page, please read and understand how :ref:`URL handling <urlconf>` works in
pretalx.

.. _urlconf:

Organiser panel views
---------------------

If you want to add a custom view to the organiser area of an event, register an URL in your
``urls.py`` that lives in the ``/orga/`` subpath::

    from django.urls import re_path

    from pretalx.event.models.event import SLUG_REGEX

    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        re_path(
            rf"^orga/event/(?P<event>{SLUG_REGEX})/p/myplugin/$",
            views.admin_view,
            name="backend",
        ),
        re_path(
            rf"^(?P<event>{SLUG_REGEX})/p/myplugin/$",
            views.frontend_view,
            name="frontend",
        ),
        re_path(
            rf"^p/myplugin/$",
            views.global_view,
            name="global-frontend",
        ),
    ]

If you just created your `urls.py` file and you already had the development
server running, youâ€™ll now have to restart it for the new file to be
recognised.

If your view is event-specific, you have to name one parameter in your URL
``event``. By convention, all plugin URLs except for backend URLs start with
a ``/p/`` to avoid namespace collisions with event names and reserved URLs.

You can then write a regular view. Our middleware will automatically detect the
``/orga/`` subpath and will ensure the following points if this is an URL with
the ``event`` parameter:

* The user has logged in
* The ``request.event`` attribute contains the current event
* The user has permission to view the current event

If you want to require specific permission types, we provide you with a decorator or a mixin for
your views::

    from pretalx.common.mixins.views import PermissionRequired

    class AdminView(PermissionRequired, View):
        permission_required = "orga.view_submissions"


There is also a signal that allows you to add the view to the event sidebar navigation like this::


    from django.dispatch import receiver
    from django.urls import resolve, reverse
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

    from pretalx.orga.signals import nav_event


    @receiver(nav_event, dispatch_uid="friends_tickets_nav")
    def navbar_info(sender, request, **kwargs):
        url = resolve(request.path_info)
        if not request.user.has_perm("orga.view_orga_area", request.event):
            return []
        return [{
            "label": _("My plugin view"),
            "icon": "heart",
            "url": reverse("plugins:myplugin:index", kwargs={
                "event": request.event.slug,
            }),
            "active": url.namespace == "plugins:myplugin" and url.url_name == "view",
        }]


Frontend views
--------------

Frontend views work pretty much like organiser area views. Take care that your
URL starts with ``fr"^(?P<event>[{SLUG_REGEX}]+)/p/mypluginname"`` for event
related URLs or ``f"^p/mypluginname"`` for global views. You can then write a
regular view. It will be automatically ensured that:

* The requested event exists
* The requested event is visible (either by being public, or if an organiser looks at it)
* The request involves the correct domain for the event
* The ``request.event`` attribute contains the correct ``Event`` object
* The organiser has enabled the plugin
* The locale middleware has processed the request
