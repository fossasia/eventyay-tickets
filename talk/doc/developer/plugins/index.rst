Plugin development
==================

The following pages will help you create your first pretalx plugin, and will
show you common plugin patterns and functionality in the “Writing a … plugin”
sections.

If you’re not quite sure what kind of plugin you’d like to work on, check out
our `plugin idea collection`_, or add entries there yourself. If you develop
a plugin, please add it to our `plugin list`_!
