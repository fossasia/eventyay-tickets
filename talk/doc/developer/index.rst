Developer documentation
=======================

You want to contribute? Thatâ€™s great, we love contributions! Being an open
source project, pretalx will thrive if it receives regular contributions from
the community. Everyone is able to contribute, and contributions come in many
forms: Code, Documentation, Translations, Graphics, Feedback â€¦.
We appreciate them highly!

This part of the documentation tries to give you some information that you
might need on the way.  But donâ€™t worry if you still get stuck: Itâ€™s probably
not you, itâ€™s us. This documentation is probably incomplete.  So do not
hesitate to send us questions -- and afterwards, contribute to the
documentation to help the next one who is running into the same problem. ðŸ˜‰
