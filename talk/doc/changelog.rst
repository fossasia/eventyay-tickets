Release Notes
=============

- :feature:`schedule` When you embed the pretalx widget on an external page, clicking on session links will open the sessions in a new tab, so attendees won't have to try to navigate back to your home page.
- :feature:`schedule` Organisers can now configure additional links to show in the top menu next to "Schedule", "Sessions", "Speakers", handy for links back to the conference website, streams, etc.
- :feature:`orga` Organisers can now configure footer links that will be shown on all schedule pages.
- :feature:`cfp` pretalx will now send an email after a user changes their password, notifying them of the change.
- :feature:`orga,1302` Organisers can now customise the template used to inform speakers when they are added to a proposal by an organiser. There are two new templates – one for speakers with an existing account, and one for speakers without account who need to set their password.
- :feature:`orga,1311` Organisers can now customise the “New proposal” notification email contents.
- :bug:`orga:schedule,1900` The HTML export did not work and exported only 404 pages if the schedule was not public.
- :feature:`schedule` When a room is empty during a day, pretalx will not show it anymore in the grid schedule (rather than only hiding rooms that are *never* used).
- :feature:`orga` You can now send or discard only a filtered list of emails from the outbox.
- :feature:`dev,1596` With the new ``queuedmail_pre_send`` signal, your plugin can modify a `QueuedMail` object before it is sent out. You can handle the sending entirely by setting the object’s `sent` attribute, or e.g. modify the email text before it is sent out by pretalx.
- :feature:`orga` Outgoing mails now know which proposals or sessions they are about. This information can’t be added to existing mails, but will be included in all new mails, which will link to the proposals in question, and will help you find relevant emails by showing the linked proposals and their track colours (if any).
- :feature:`orga:schedule` When exporting your sessions or submissions as CSV or JSON, you can now choose to export start and end times as separate date/time values instead of a single combined value.
- :bug:`orga,1879` The template indicator (showing you which template an email was generated from) in the email lists were invisible.
- :feature:`schedule` The schedule widget can now be used for a selected number of dates, which is very useful when some of your rooms are not in use on some days (like switching to a workshop-heavy programme on some conference days). For conferences like this, you could embed the schedule widget twice: Once for one set of days and once for the other set.
- :bug:`schedule,1874` The calendar parts of the public schedule (day of week, month) were always in English, even if another language was selected.
- :bug:`orga` Dragging and dropping questions and other elements to change their order was broken in Google Chrome.
- :bug:`orga:schedule` The HTML export did not work and exported only 404 pages.
- :bug:`cfp` The upload of files with very long file names would fail instead of showing an error message. pretalx will now truncate the filename instead.
- :bug:`orga:schedule` When exporting all your sessions as CSV or JSON export, only the end time would be in the local timezone, but the start time would be in UTC – both timestamps included the full timezone, so if you went on to parse them with a program, this likely would not matter, but it was confusing regardless. The export now uses the event timezone, as intended.
- :bug:`orga` When entering a HTML colour manually instead of using the colour picker, pretalx would expand a three-letter colour to a six-letter colour (e.g. #123 to #112233), which is technically correct, but also not helpful when you’re in the process of typing out a six-letter colour, so pretalx will now not expand these colours anymore.
- :feature:`orga` In order to make it easier for organisers of multiple events to see which event they are currently editing, the green line in the top navigation bar is now of the current event’s colour instead.
- :feature:`orga:review` Reviewers were shown the proposal state dropdown, even when they did not have the necessary permissions to change a proposal’s state. They are now shown a non-interactive badge instead, and the same badge is also used on the frontend-side for speakers.
- :release:`2024.3.1 <2024-10-27>`
- :bug:`schedule` The schedule would work only intermittently when used with a custom domain.
- :bug:`cfp` The resource upload form always mentioned a hard-coded file upload limit (but would in reality allow files up to the size of the real file upload limit).
- :bug:`schedule` Sessions with session image would not look good on some mobile devices.
- :bug:`orga,1839` If the organisers initially showed the “do not record” checkbox, but then hid it, the sessions marked as unrecorded would still show the appropriate icon in the public schedule, without anybody being able to uncheck the checkbox. Instead, the indicator is now hidden if the checkbox can’t be accessed anymore.
- :release:`2024.3.0 <2024-10-21>`
- :feature:`orga` You can now drag rooms, tracks, questions, and even question options to reorder them.
- :feature:`admin` You can now configure the maximum file upload size.
- :feature:`cfp` You can now submit a form from textboxes with Ctrl+Enter.
- :feature:`cfp` In browsers that support it (currently only Chrome), textboxes will now auto-expand when you write more text, rather than showing a scrollbar.
- :feature:`schedule` When you look at a talk detail page, the start and end time is now also given in your local time (if you are not in the event timezone).
- :feature:`orga:submission` The proposal list can now be sorted by session type and track.
- :feature:`cfp` Organisers can now turn off the public “secret” proposal share URLs.
- :bug:`cfp` On some registration pages, the password strength indicator was missing.
- :announcement:`dev` pretalx has dropped its use of SCSS, Bootstrap (while retaining a lot of style rules) and jQuery. If you rely on these in your plugin, you will need to adjust your code. If you require jQuery, you can load `static/js/jquery.js`, as this is still shipped with pretalx core. You can continue using SCSS, but you'll have to use CSS variables rather than SCSS variables, but we do expose all previous SCSS variables as CSS variables.
- :feature:`admin` pretalx is now better about deleting uploaded files that are not in use anymore, as well as giving predictable filenames to user profile pictures.
- :bug:`orga` Deleting review phases and review score categories was broken.
- :feature:`schedule` The schedule navigation to switch between schedule, talk list, and speakers, is now always visible and easier to find.
- :feature:`orga` Organisers can now open the quick-nav menu with the Alt-K shortcut.
- :feature:`orga` In order to make the many settings pages more manageable, they are now grouped into tabs.
- :feature:`orga` Whenever users can select an item associated with a colour (e.g. a track, an event), the colour is also shown in the drop-down.
- :feature:`orga` On the landing page in the organiser area, there are now links to the events the current user has submitted proposals to, in order to help guide speakers back to the speaker frontend from the (to-them empty) organiser backend.
- :feature:`orga` There is now an organiser-level dashboard with an events list and team list.
- :feature:`schedule` The schedule page makes even better use of several caching methods in order to be smaller and faster to load and re-load.
- :announcement:`admin` The ``regenerate_css`` command has been dropped without replacement, as it was not needed anymore.
- :announcement:`admin` Due to a potentially tricky update in Django, and maintenance cost, pretalx is dropping support for MySQL/MariaDB. Please use either PostgreSQL or SQLite. If you are currently running MySLQ, please take a look at this exemplary `MySQL migration guide<https://pretix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/mysql2postgres.html>`_ by the pretix project **BEFORE** starting your pretalx update, in order to migrate your data with ``pgloader`` to PostgreSQL!
- :announcement:`admin` pretalx now requires Python 3.10 or newer.
- :feature:`orga` Organisers now have access to a list of all speakers / submitters for all of their events.
- :bug:`orga:schedule,1828` When exporting an event to a HTML export, files with umlauts or other non-ASCII characters in their file name were saved with the encoded version of that name, so when the export was served by a web server, these files wouldn't be shown.
- :bug:`schedule` When organisers initially asked speakers to upload a profile picture, but then turned off the upload, the profile pictures collected to that date would still show up in the schedule grid and on the individual speaker pages. They will now be hidden from view.
- :bug:`orga` Organisers could inadvertently remove all access to an event when they updated their team permissions. Pretalx now forbids this, and additionally shows warnings when an event is being orphaned by a team change.
- :feature:`orga` A lot of info boxes that are mostly useful to new or inexperienced users are now hidden behind ❓ symbols rather than being always visible.
- :bug:`cfp` The "additional speaker" form field would be shown even after a proposal had been submitted, even though there is a more detailed dedicated page to add new speakers at that point. The field now won't be shown on the proposal edit page.
- :feature:`orga:speaker` Speaker profile pictures are now shown in more places.
- :feature:`orga` Most organiser pages now have a useful tab title.
- :bug:`orga` When copying an old event's settings to a new one, questions were copied, but their answer options (for choice/multiple choice questions) were omitted.
- :bug:`orga:email` When sending an email to only speakers with a specific question answer, emails would instead be generated (and placed in the outbox, not sent!) to all speakers.
- :bug:`orga:submission` When organisers filtered the session list by specific question answers, adding search terms or filters would reset the question filter.
- :bug:`schedule` When the pretalx schedule widget was used with an event that didn't have a public schedule, it would show a loading spinner indefinitely. It now shows a message that the schedule is not available.
- :feature:`schedule,1002` Logged-in users can now download an iCal file with their starred talks.
- :feature:`schedule` For logged in users, pretalx will now save the list of starred/favourited talks, so that you can sync the starred talks across devices.
- :feature:`schedule` If a talk won't be recorded, this will now be shown in the schedule, rather than just on the individual talk pages.
- :feature:`schedule,1794` The iCal schedule export has been made private (available only to organisers) as the utility of importing a conference's entire schedule is limited, and people were frustrated that the iCal export did not reflect any applied schedule filters.
- :bug:`schedule,1803` The QR code for schedule exporter links was not showing up when hovering on the QR code symbol.
- :release:`2024.2.1 <2024-08-07>`
- :bug:`orga` The plugin list was always shown as empty, even when there were plugins installed.
- :feature:`orga` Administrators can now also deactivate user accounts, which will log out that user and won't allow them to log in again.
- :release:`2024.2.0 <2024-08-06>`
- :bug:`orga` The markdown preview posed a security vulnerability by allowing speakers and organisers to include unsafe JavaScript. This JavaScript would only be executed when accessing the preview, i.e. when a speaker or organiser opened to proposal page (not attendees or the public). Thanks to Jorian Woltjer for reporting this issue.
- :feature:`api` The submission API now has a filter for the ``is_featured`` field.
- :feature:`cfp,1761` In the CfP submission multi-step form, the tab title now reflects the proposal title, to make it easier to work on multiple proposal submissions at the same time.
- :bug:`orga:speaker,1768` When filtering the speaker list by only accepted/confirmed speakers, the listed proposal count would be incorrect (inflated).
- :feature:`cfp,1574` pretalx now supports the ``~~`` strikethrough syntax in Markdown.
- :bug:`orga:schedule,1702` Sessions starting at exactly midnight of the first day of the event would not show up in the schedule editor (but could be scheduled there by dropping them on the day heading).
- :feature:`orga:schedule,1730` The schedule editor now allows you to schedule talks that are only "pending accepted" (i.e. the speaker has not yet received the acceptance email), so that organisers can try out how their schedule would look with a given number of tentatively accepted proposals.
- :feature:`orga` Administrators (i.e. instance owners) can now search a list of all users, which includes their teams and permissions, and links to trigger account deletion and password resets.
- :bug:`orga:review` Assigning reviewers could lead to incorrect assignments when browsers cached the form, but new reviewers were added to the team, shifting the overall order of input fields.
- :feature:`cfp` Choice and multiple choice questions now use a drop-down with typeahead (search for options) when they have a lot of options.
- :feature:`orga,1079` All images in forms in the organiser area now include a preview of the saved image, and open a lightbox instead of the image file when clicked.
- :announcement:`admin` We now recommend that you use a virtualenv instead of the ``pip --user`` installation method, and have updated our install and upgrade documentation accordingly.
- :bug:`orga` While organisers could reorder questions, and the order was saved and used in the frontend, the new order was not shown in the organiser backend.
- :feature:`orga` All tables in the organiser area now come with sticky headers, to accommodate the possible increased length of the tables.
- :bug:`orga:submission,1704` The proposal list could not be filtered by answers to questions of the type choice/multiple choice.
- :bug:`cfp,1700` When using the new Dutch locale, users were unable to use the availability picker, as the locale was missing from the calendar.
- :bug:`orga:review` In the new bulk review feature, reviewers had to review all proposals at once if the event’s settings required review scores or comments to be set. Now, the bulk review feature permits partial reviews.
- :bug:`orga:schedule,1698` The HTML export failed to render the schedule page due to an incorrect URL.
- :bug:`schedule,1694` The XML schedule export was missing all speaker information.
- :release:`2024.1.0 <2024-02-16>`
- :feature:`lang` pretalx now comes with new translations, in Dutch and Italian!
- :feature:`orga,820` Restricted tracks now link to the page where you can create access codes for that track.
- :announcement:`admin,1678` Due to its incomplete and complex nature, the ``import_schedule`` admin command has been removed. If you want to import a schedule, despite all the complexities, please use the pretalx-downstream plugin instead.
- :feature:`orga,1672` The organiser area now has a search box located in the side bar, opened after clicking the event name. It searches all events the current user has full access to (that is, not a limited reviewer account) for events, sessions and speakers.
- :feature:`orga:review,1633` Resources uploaded or linked by speakers are now shown in the review view (unless anonymous reviews are used, as resources can currently not be anonymised).
- :feature:`orga:review,1675` In order to make large events more manageable, the review dashboard is now by default paginated to 100 sessions per page. The page size can be adjusted up to showing all sessions as before (and the page size is remembered on a per-user basis).
- :feature:`orga` The default page size for paginated pages has been increased to 50.
- :feature:`orga:review` Reviewers can now review all proposals at the same time in bulk, as an alternative to reviewing them one by one.
- :feature:`orga` Organisers can now upload question options in bulk, which is particularly handy for questions with many options, like country lists.
- :feature:`orga:email,1351` pretalx now provides two new email placeholders, ``speaker_schedule_new`` (all talks changed in the current schedule, like in the notification email generated on schedule release) and ``speaker_schedule_full`` (a list of **all** scheduled sessions for that user).
- :bug:`schedule,1666` When building the social media preview card, pretalx would display a session’s description rather than its abstract.
- :bug:`cfp,1660` When setting character limits on text questions, pretalx would count line breaks as two characters.
- :bug:`orga:submission,1613` The session page drop-down would sometimes include the "public link" even though it was not public yet. This has been fixed, and in the case of accepted or confirmed proposals that don’t have a public page yet (e.g. because they’re not scheduled yet), the link is marked as "public link (not public yet)".
- :bug:`cfp` When rendering email addresses in Markdown, shorter TLDs won out against longer ones (e.g. .co instead of .com, or .ro instead of .rocks). This was already fixed for normal links, just not for email addresses. Until you update to include this fix, you can instead turn emails into a link yourself: ``[test@example.co](mailto:test@example.co)``.
- :feature:`orga,1619` Organisers can now add new team members in bulk instead of one by one.
- :feature:`orga:schedule,1587` A hint now shows when users click the "New break" box, informing them that they have to drag it to the schedule instead.
- :feature:`orga:schedule` Breaks now also show their start time and duration in the schedule editor.
- :feature:`schedule` Breaks now also show their start time and duration in the schedule.
- :bug:`orga:speaker` The buttons to mark speakers as arrived would only show up once an event was over.
- :bug:`orga:email,848` When looking at an email, the sidebar now correctly indicates if it is a sent or queued email (rather than always highlighting the "Outbox" menu entry).
- :feature:`orga:email,1402` When you accept a previously rejected proposal (or vice versa), pretalx will warn you if there is a conflicting email waiting in the outbox, to prevent you from accidentally sending both an acceptance and a rejection email.
- :feature:`orga,1336` In the CfP settings, a warning will be shown next to the deadline setting if some session types have different deadlines.
- :feature:`schedule,1324` Session and speaker images will now be shown in an overlay on click, instead of opening a new page.
- :feature:`orga:email,1350` pretalx will now warn you if you have empty URLs in email templates (which can easily happen with Markdown by accident).
- :feature:`orga:email,1244` Emails can now be sent both per-speaker and per-proposal, though some placeholders are not available in per-speaker emails (such as the proposal title).
- :feature:`orga:email` Improved email editor: Placeholders are now listed in the sidebar and inserted on click.
- :feature:`orga:email,1254` Organisers can now also send emails to reviewers or other team members.
- :bug:`orga:speaker` An organiser-specific help text on room availability forms would show up for speaker availabilities, too.
- :bug:`orga` Review scores and phases were not copied correctly when copying event settings.
- :bug:`orga:schedule` Sessions could not be scheduled for midnight via drag’n’drop (though scheduling via the session form still worked as a workaround).
- :feature:`orga:schedule` The schedule editor page can now be printed – page breaks can still occur in odd places, but it’s otherwise a very readable schedule (with your selection of rooms).
- :feature:`dev` Plugins can now inject content into a page’s HTML ``<head>`` tag with the ``pretalx.orga.signals.html_head`` signal.
- :bug:`orga` Answers for URL questions were not included in JSON/CSV exports
- :announcement:`schedule` The primary URL of widget scripts and widget data has changed. The old URLs will continue to work until at least the last 2024 release.
- :announcement:`schedule` The old v1 schedule widget, which has been deprecated for a long time, has been removed.
- :feature:`orga` Tracks and session types in speaker information notes have a better interface, helpful for events with many of either of them.
- :feature:`orga:review,1462` Reviewers can now remove their reviews (while they can still be edited).
- :feature:`dev` Plugins can now also render nested menu entries in the sidebar navigation.
- :feature:`orga,1107` pretalx now warns users when they try to leave a page with unsaved changes.
- :feature:`cfp,1107` pretalx now warns users when they try to leave a page with unsaved changes.
- :feature:`schedule,1041` Talks can now be starred (added to the list of favourite talks) from the talk page, not just from the schedule page.
- :feature:`dev` Plugins can now declare their category, which is used to group them in the plugin list. Available categories are "Feature", "Integration", "Customisation", "Exporter", "Recording", "Language" and "Other". Plugins without a set category will be grouped as "Other". If you’re a plugin developer, please update your plugin to declare a category!
- :feature:`admin,1588` Administrators can now see their pretalx version in the admin dashboard.
- :bug:`schedule` RSS feeds for new releases would sometimes fail to load if control characters were used in the schedule version or event name.
- :bug:`cfp` Draft proposals could not be discarded if they included answered questions.
- :bug:`lang` When using two variants of the same language in the same event, pretalx would not reliably switch between the two variants.
- :feature:`orga:email` Email signatures are now also parsed as markdown, so line breaks will show up in HTML email signatures as expected.
- :bug:`admin` CSS regeneration of event styles was broken and left events stuck on their last selected colour.
- :feature:`orga` When creating an event with copied event settings, custom email templates are now included.
- :feature:`cfp,1534` pretalx now adds hints for password managers to make the dual login/registration form easier to navigate.
- :feature:`orga` Organisers can now change the pagination size of all list pages, with a choice of 25, 50 or 100.
- :feature:`orga,1576` Tracks can now be ordered, and the order is used both in drop-down and in the schedule.
- :release:`2023.1.3 <2023-09-16>`
- :bug:`lang` Flags for some languages were not being displayed in the organiser area.
- :release:`2023.1.1 <2023-09-16>`
- :bug:`lang` For users without a pretalx account, their browser’s choice of language took precedence over their own language selection.
- :bug:`lang` When using non-standard languages, pretalx would only show those languages as available sometimes.
- :bug:`admin,1579` There was a bug in the `pretalx init` command, and also too verbose output.
- :bug:`orga,1577` The printable proposal cards showed broken characters for anything outside Latin1.
- :bug:`orga` Reordering questions while some of them were inactive could lead to 404 errors.
- :bug:`orga:submission` pretalx was not able to filter pending state changes from the organiser proposal list.
- :bug:`lang` The schedule editor was not operational with some languages, particularly with different language code versions (e.g. Brazilian versus European Portuguese).
- :bug:`orga:schedule` The schedule editor would not show some specific time selectors when people expanded the timeline to see five-minute steps.
- :release:`2023.1.0 <2023-08-30>`
- :feature:`orga:schedule` Completely rewrote the schedule editor, making it look like the actual schedule, and added some powerful features like hiding rooms, easy duration changes, and more.
- :feature:`admin` The ``pretalx init`` command now has a ``--no-input`` flag for all your automation needs.
- :announcement:`admin` pretalx no longer logs 404 responses, as you can get those equally from your web server logs.
- :feature:`schedule,399` pretalx will now locally cache gravatar avatars to avoid GDPR issues when using gravatar.
- :bug:`schedule,1498` Talks that were scheduled, but not confirmed by the speaker yet would be shown in the public speaker profile.
- :feature:`orga:review` pretalx always showed the anonymised version of proposals if there was one. Now it reverts to the non-anonymised one once the anonymisation period is over.
- :feature:`orga:speaker` Organiser pages for speakers now use their alphanumeric ``code`` identifier in the URL rather than the numeric ID, matching the public and API pages.
- :feature:`orga:submission,1347` The submission type and track lists now include links to the filtered list of proposals.
- :feature:`cfp,889` A talk’s duration is now listed on the talk acceptance site to avoid misunderstandings early on.
- :announcement:`admin` Due to database versions going EOL, please make sure to use PostgreSQL 12+, MySQL 8+, MariaDB 10.4+, or SQLite 3.21.
- :announcement:`admin` As Python 3.6 and 3.7 are now EOL, and we are using new Python features, pretalx supports Python versions 3.9+.
- :feature:`orga:review` The review dashboard can now be filtered by question answers, just like the submission list.
- :feature:`orga:submission` New anonymisation indicator in proposal list.
- :feature:`cfp,1418` Speaker availabilities are now limited to the sum of all room availabilities.
- :feature:`orga,1440` The list of team members is now always sorted by name.
- :announcement:`admin` Document that in nginx, gzip should be turned on only for static files.
- :bug:`admin,1098` There was a very rare bug that could lock up pretalx instances due to a race condition in the review process, and required manual admin intervention to get fixed.
- :feature:`orga,1061` Image previews (e.g. for event logos) now handle transparency by adding a chequered background, so even the white logo fans can still see their images.
- :feature:`orga,963` The featured talks page is now linked in the corresponding setting, making it easier for organisers to find.
- :feature:`orga:submission,392` Our longest-standing feature request has finally been closed: You can now set the possible proposal/content languages independently from the available UI languages.
- :bug:`cfp,1363` pretalx now shows the actual file upload limit to users uploading resources rather than a slightly too-large one.
- :feature:`orga` You can’t accidentally remove all permissions from a team anymore.
- :feature:`api` Added the ``tag_ids`` attribute in the proposal API for organisers.
- :bug:`orga:email` The reject email template was missing on the template list.
- :feature:`admin` Administrators can now change event short names in the frontend rather than having to dig into the database.
- :feature:`schedule,699` In the emails sent to speakers when their talks change, they will now also receive calendar files for the changed talks.
- :feature:`orga:review,1185` Reviewers will see a tick next to talks they have submitted, so they won’t appear like things they should review.
- :feature:`orga:review` In the review dashboards, users can now remove and add columns, including the track, session duration and shorter questions.
- :feature:`api` The submission API now includes IDs for submission types, tracks and rooms, rather than just references by name.
- :feature:`cfp,672` Speakers (or rather submitters) can now save a proposal as a draft while they are working on finishing the submission process.
- :feature:`cfp` The state of a proposal is now marked as "in review" on the speaker-facing side once the CfP closes, to make it clearer that there is no action to be taken at that time.
- :feature:`api` Breaking API change: The submissions, talks and speakers API endpoints do not include all question answers the user has access to by default anymore, due to performance considerations. You can restore the old behaviour with ``?questions=all``, or ``?questions=id,id`` to show selected answers instead.
- :feature:`schedule` Track descriptions are now shown publicly on the schedule page, in the track filter.
- :feature:`schedule` You can now filter the schedule by proposal track.
- :feature:`schedule` If organisers provide a room description, it is now shown in the room header in the grid schedule.
- :bug:`orga:schedule,515` pretalx sometimes mysteriously creates two new schedules when releasing one, and then is in a confused and broken state until an administrator intervenes. Now pretalx can fix the situation on its own (though we still do not know how this ever happens).
- :bug:`api` The schedule API did not work to retrieve historical schedule versions when the schedule version included a dot, as it often does.
- :feature:`api` The schedule API now also includes breaks.
- :feature:`orga:email` In the email outbox, pretalx now shows if a pending email comes from a known template, e.g. if it is an accept or reject email.
- :feature:`orga:submission` You can now exclude proposals with pending state changes from your search results.
- :feature:`orga:email` To improve email template handling, the list of emails now shows just the subjects or use case, and you can click them to expand and see the details.
- :feature:`schedule` Breaks are now also shown on the mobile/minimal/linear schedule.
- :bug:`orga:review` Review pages were not working when pretalx was run with Python 3.7 and the aggregation method "mean" (as opposed to "median").
- :feature:`orga` Teams are now sorted by the date of their accessible events, making it easier to manage organisers with many event-specific teams.
- :bug:`schedule` The schedule widget was not showing up for some locales (particularly Chinese).
- :feature:`schedule` On sessions that have both videos and images, videos now show up first, and the overall layout is improved.
- :feature:`orga:schedule` Schedule release warnings are now more actionable, by linking to more problematic proposals directly, or to a page listing all affected proposals for less complex warnings.
- :bug:`orga` The statistics page had an off-by-one problem with the timeline, where every date was shown as one day earlier.
- :feature:`orga:review` If you limit reviewer teams to specific tracks, they won’t be able to see speaker profiles from outside their track(s) anymore.
- :feature:`schedule` Not so much a feature as a change: Speaker images are now cropped to the centre in the speaker list squares instead of to the top.
- :bug:`schedule` Fix social media preview images sometimes not showing up due to robots.txt constraints.
- :feature:`schedule` Use speaker profile images as social media preview where possible (does not include gravatar support at the moment).
- :feature:`schedule` Header images are now used as fallback for social media preview images if there’s no logo.
- :bug:`cfp` Events with per-submission-type questions sometimes saw empty questions pages in the CfP flow.
- :feature:`orga:review` Organisers can now assign reviewers to proposals in bulk, by uploading a JSON file.
- :feature:`dev` Two new signals: ``agenda.html_above_session_pages`` and ``agenda.html_below_session_pages`` allow plugins to add custom text to the public schedule session pages.
- :feature:`schedule` The schedule widget can now be given a top margin at which to stop the scrolling of its room/day headers.
- :feature:`cfp,1301` Following a confirmation link to a proposal you don’t have access to now shows a helpful page prompting you to double-check your account is correct. Anonymous users will be directed to log in first.

- :bug:`cfp,1307` Availability times provided while confirming a proposal were not saved.

- :feature:`orga:review,619` Reviewers can now be assigned to proposals directly. Depending on your settings, reviewers can only see their assigned proposals, or will just see them highlighted.
- :feature:`schedule` Caching of schedule pages is reset the moment a new schedule version is released, so that integrations (for example with Venueless) that push notifications on new schedule releases will always see the actual new schedule.

- :feature:`lang,947` In all exporters, you can now select the export language with the ``?lang=`` query parameter. If you don’t supply the parameter, pretalx will continue to guess your locale as before. If you provide the parameter without a value, the default event locale will be used.
- :feature:`schedule,934` Instead of being unsorted as before, the list of talks on the schedule page is now sorted alphabetically.
- :bug:`api,936` The submission API returned a duration in formatted time, like "00:30", but the API documentation claimed it was a number of minutes. pretalx now returns the number of minutes as promised.
- :feature:`cfp,915` Tracks now have a description attached to them which is shown to the user in the CfP, if specified. This can be used to further explain an otherwise very short track name.
- :feature:`admin` Redirects to an event domain now include CORS headers to permit access from any client, to make pretalx integration in other websites easier.

- :bug:`orga:review` Firefox has a bug in their form caching. If you reviewed a submission, clicked "Save and next", then *went back and reloaded the page*, Firefox would incorrectly fill your review form with the choice *one point worse* than your original selection. If you then chose "Save and next" again, this value would be saved.
- :feature:`dev` The test event creation command now allows you to specify the event slug. This allows you to generate multiple test events in various event stages.

- :feature:`orga:email` Schedule notifications for speakers are now properly connected to the speaker accounts, instead of just referencing them by email addresses.

- :bug:`admin` Under specific circumstances, the ``django_sessions`` table could bloat a lot. This is fixed with the next release and the table will shrink over time as long as you regularly run the ``clearsessions`` command.
- :feature:`orga:speaker,855` The filtered list of speakers in the organiser area now contains only people with confirmed *or accepted* talks, and is also better at showing the filter currently applied.

- :feature:`orga,880` The submission statistics now ignore deleted submissions.
- :announcement:`admin` This version of pretalx has higher database version requirements. We now support PostgreSQL 9.6+, MariaDB 10.1+, MySQL 5.6+, and SQLite 3.8.3+.
- :bug:`cfp,877` The frontend markdown preview would not render all line breaks as line breaks (only two line breaks in a row), but the server rendered version did.
- :feature:`orga,873` If you create a new event and copy an old event’s configuration, pretalx will now also copy tracks and questions.

- :feature:`api` In the API, the event list is now sorted so that the oldest event comes last, not first as it was before.
- :feature:`lang` If your event has only a single language configured, pretalx won’t show the language flag in the input fields anymore.

- :feature:`lang` pretalx now comes with an updated French translation, and a brand new Chinese community translation!
- :bug:`orga:email,863` If incorrect variables were used in the schedule update email template, pretalx did not catch this mistake ahead of time, and instead just refused to release a new schedule.
- :feature:`-` A lot of minor UI improvements, a re-work of the colours and fonts in use, as well as improvements of mobile and responsive pages.

- :bug:`cfp` Not all CfP form help text parts were translated.
- :release:`1.1.0 <2019-12-21>`
- :feature:`admin` pretalx now comes with an update check, which will notify you when new pretalx or plugin versions are available. This check sends anonymous data to the pretalx.com server, which is run by the pretalx developer. The data consist of a random but stable ID, the number of total and public events, and the version of pretalx and all installed plugins. No identifying information will be retained, and there is a visible and persistent opt-out warning until acknowledged by an administrator.
- :bug:`admin` One broken task among the periodically executed task would prevent others from being executed.
- :bug:`schedule,828` Deleted talks could still be shown with their previous title and speaker. Now they are always replaced with a box saying "[deleted]" with no further information.

- :feature:`orga:submission,792` There is now a CSV export for answered questions.
- :feature:`cfp,814` Questions of the type "choose one from a list" are now shown as a list of radio input options instead of a single drop-down, if there are three or less options to choose from.
- :feature:`dev` Plugins can now implement the ``uninstalled`` method to perform actions when a user deactivates them for an event.
- :announcement:`admin` We documented the implicit requirement that the filesystem pretalx accesses should work with non-ASCII file names. Please check the installation documentation if you want to make sure this is the case for you.
- :feature:`orga:submission` The submission type list and the track list now list the numbers of submissions per entry.
- :feature:`orga:review,638` You can now determine if the answers to talk questions should be visible to reviewers. This allows you to ask personal questions of your submitters, even when you are running an anonymous review process.
- :feature:`orga,648` pretalx now comes with a CfP editor that allows you to change the headline, text, and help texts on each of the CfP step pages.
- :feature:`api,760` Speakers can now see and reset their API token in their profile page.
- :announcement:`dev` We have added a couple of pages to the pretalx wiki on GitHub, most importantly a list of events using pretalx, and a list of available plugins. The wiki is world-writable, so please add to it if you have an event or plugin that has not been mentioned yet!
- :feature:`orga:schedule,277` The static HTML export will now be triggered when talk or speaker data is changed (as long as it’s also generated on schedule release). To protect against high server load, it will still run at most once every hour.
- :feature:`schedule` To reduce scroll wheel abrasions, pretalx schedules are now tabbed with one tab per event day.
- :feature:`schedule,242` pretalx has learned what breaks are. Organisers can create those in the schedule editor, and they will be shown in an appropriately muted way in the schedule.
- :feature:`cfp,324` Organisers can create access tokens that allow users to submit after the CfP deadline, or that give access to hidden tracks or submission types.
- :feature:`dev` pretalx has the new management command ``create_test_event``, which creates a demo event in a stage of your choice (``cfp``, ``review``, ``schedule`` or ``over``). All user accounts are created with ``@example.org`` email addresses.
- :feature:`schedule` If you want to display your schedule on your own homepage, pretalx now offers you a schedule widget. You can generate the code for the widget in your organiser settings.
- :feature:`dev` If pretalx encounters an error it can’t recover from, the error page now shows a link to a partially filled GitHub issue.
- :bug:`cfp` pretalx would show an error when users were asked to select their submission’s track during the CfP workflow.

- :feature:`orga` Allow users to add an imprint URL that will be shown at the bottom of every public event page.
- :bug:`schedule` On the sneak peek preview page, markdown was not rendered correctly to HTML.
- :feature:`dev` If pretalx is running in development mode, its favicon will be red.
- :feature:`dev` Plugin authors will now have access to all configuration sections starting with ``[plugin:*]``, to ease the integration of system level settings.
- :feature:`api,787` Provide the file uploads a speaker added to their submission via the ``/talks`` and ``/submissions`` API endpoint.
- :feature:`cfp` Show speakers how many feedback notes have been left (if any) in their personal submission list view.
- :feature:`schedule` Answers to boolean questions are not displayed as "yes", "no", and "maybe" in public display, instead of "true" or "false".
- :bug:`orga:schedule,775` When a speaker withdrew their already-accepted talk, the talk slot was not removed from the schedule editor. It did work when setting the state via the organiser interface.
- :bug:`api,774` The API endpoint for events always returned a 404 on the detail view, even when event was visible in the list view.
- :feature:`api` Speaker and talk detail pages now contain links to their respective API detail pages as alternate links.
- :feature:`schedule` The main schedule page now returns a 303 See Also redirect if accessed with JSON or XML accept headers.
- :bug:`api,773` In the ``/talks`` and ``/submissions`` endpoints, speaker biographies were not exposed. They were available in the ``/speakers`` endpoint as expected, so if you cannot currently upgrade, please be advised to use that endpoint.
- :feature:`cfp` Organisers can now disable/remove the profile picture input field if they don’t want any speaker pictures at all.
- :feature:`orga` The event creation assistant now suggests more sensible event slugs.
- :feature:`cfp` The time(s), date(s) and location(s) of scheduled talks were added to the private speaker pages of those talks, making it easier for speakers to find out when and where their talk is taking place.
- :feature:`api` The API is now also available as an HTML browsable API. Filters and searches should be working as well as just browsing around.
- :feature:`api` The events API endpoint now comes with a field exposing links to the schedule page, and the login page, among other things.
- :bug:`api,754` Reviews could be returned multiple times in the reviews API endpoint (though the total count returned was correct).
- :feature:`cfp,742` Organisers can now set a minimum or maximum length for submission titles.
- :feature:`schedule,743` If no schedule has been published but a sneak peek is available, the schedule page now redirects to the sneak peek page.
- :feature:`cfp` The pretalx markdown display now supports markdown tables.
- :feature:`orga:schedule` Due to the powerful and hard-to-specify nature of the schedule HTML import, the frontend facing schedule XML import has been removed. Administrators can still import schedule files with the ``import_schedule`` command.
- :release:`1.0.3 <2019-06-27>`
- :bug:`schedule,730` The talk page of talks with multiple slots did not work and threw an error instead.
- :bug:`orga:schedule,729` The “unscheduled talks” column in the schedule editor could overlap with the room columns on events with many rooms.
- :bug:`orga,728` The “Invite reviewers” link on the main event dashboard led to an incorrect page.
- :feature:`api,732` Speaker availability is now included in the API for organisers.
- :feature:`orga:email,475` Organisers can now regenerate the accept/reject emails from the review dashboard context menu.
- :announcement:`admin` To keep in line with our new database scoping, if you access the pretalx shell, you are now advised to use the ``shell_scoped`` command instead of the ``shell`` command, and call it with the flags for your event, like ``--event__slug=my-event`` (or an ``--override`` flag to access all events).
- :feature:`cfp,731` Users can now see (and potentially edit) their submission’s submission type.
- :bug:`orga` Some custom domains could not be set via the frontend.
- :feature:`schedule` Organisers can now also see unconfirmed talks in their preview of the public schedule page. The unconfirmed talks are clearly marked to avoid confusion.
- :release:`1.0.2 <2019-06-07>`
- :bug:`orga:email` Organisers were able to see all emails sent to a user in their events, instead of only emails sent for the currently active event. This is a data leak. You can find more information `on our blog <https://pretalx.com/p/news/incident-report-data-leak-in-pretalx-10/>`_.
- :feature:`admin` We now add a hash to all uploaded file names to avoid collisions.
- :release:`1.0.1 <2019-06-03>`
- :bug:`cfp,719` In the submission process, file upload questions would not be saved correctly.
- :bug:`orga:schedule,713` The sneak peek toggle in the submission list did not actually work due to a changed URL.
- :bug:`admin,718` Regular installation from PyPI was broken due to an incorrect file reference.
- :release:`1.0.0 <2019-06-02>`
- :feature:`cfp,427` Organisers can now permit users to submit (and change) their own talk duration length.
- :feature:`cfp,700` Submitters can now choose to withdraw their talk even if it was accepted. When an accepted talk is withdrawn, the organisers will receive a notification email.
- :feature:`schedule` When using a command line client to access a schedule page, pretalx will now output ASCII tables or lists, depending on the format parameter.
- :feature:`cfp,402` Fields with markdown support now come with a preview next to the input field (if JavaScript is enabled).
- :feature:`orga:email,669` Emails can now also be sent grouped by submission track or submission type.
- :announcement:`admin` You can now install ``pretalx[redis]`` if you use pretalx with a redis server for better caching and/or asynchronous task runners.
- :announcement:`admin` Our documentation now lists the tasks a pretalx instance should run periodically, namely ``runperiodic`` about once every five minutes, and ``clearsessions`` about once a month.
- :feature:`admin` Administrators can now see a dashboard with relevant settings and current information, including documentation links.
- :bug:`api,689` In the (undocumented) review API, reviews of deleted submissions were shown, even though those submissions were not available anymore via the frontend.
- :bug:`orga:email,688` pretalx was inconsistent in its usage of email senders and Reply-To. Now, if there is a sender address configured, the Reply-To is not explicitly set. pretalx falls back to the instance-global sender if there is no event sender address. A Reply-To setting is available if the organisers wish to provide a separate address there.
- :feature:`api,682` The submission endpoint now provides a ``created`` field to organiser users.
- :feature:`orga,326` During event creation, pretalx provides more critical feedback, such as asking if the event is supposed to take place in the past, or suggesting good slugs.
- :feature:`orga,393` As an alternative to file uploads, organisers can now also provide their custom CSS directly as text.
- :feature:`orga:review,360` Within the review dashboard, organisers can now accept and reject multiple submissions at the same time.
- :feature:`orga:review,656` Instead of by average, review scores are now shown aggregated by the median.
- :bug:`orga:email,655` Mails to submissions with titles near the length cap (of 200 characters) could not be created, since with the added "[event]" prefix the mail subject was too long to be saved.
- :feature:`orga` Question pages now feature visual statistics where appropriate.
- :feature:`orga:submission` There now is a page for submission statistics.
- :feature:`cfp,628` Fill CfP form with track and submission type if they are available in the query string.
- :announcement:`admin` pretalx is now able to run with Python 3.7 even when using Celery.
- :feature:`orga:review,598` Via the new review phase settings, speakers can be allowed to modify their submissions while they are being reviewed.
- :feature:`schedule,641` At the undocumented URL `/<event>/speaker/by-id/123/` there is now a redirect to the canonical speaker URL `/<event>/speaker/CODE/` to work around export format restrictions.
- :bug:`cfp,565` When using the back button to return to the previous step in the submission workflow, the data from the current step had to be filled in to use the button, but was not saved. Now it will be saved, and the progress bar on top can be used for lossy (but quick) navigation to the previous step.
- :bug:`orga:email,645` The rendering of the full submission content in the acknowledgement mail (upon submission) looked weird in HTML, due to missing line breaks.
- :bug:`cfp,646` On slow network connections, the login step of the CfP submission loaded in a sub-optimal way, leaving users with a seemingly finished page but without the login/registration form. As a consequence, all page loads (but especially that one) were optimised.
- :bug:`cfp,642` Having only one submission type in the event showed a drop-down with submission types from ALL events, instead of hiding the submission type input completely as intended.
- :feature:`orga:submission,609` Organisers can now filter submissions and reviews by track.
- :feature:`api,634` The API now provides internal notes by speakers and organisers to requesting users with adequate permissions.
- :feature:`orga` Organiser can now provide a header image instead of a header colour and pattern for their events.
- :feature:`orga:schedule,640` Instead of having to scroll with the mouse wheel or arrow keys when dragging a talk in the schedule editor, you can now just drag the talk to the upper or lower edge of the window instead.
- :feature:`orga:email` In pretalx, emails the organisers send out are now connected with user accounts if the address matches anybody, allowing organisers and speakers to see which emails were sent to a speaker. This serves both as a help for organisers and speakers, in case emails get lost, email addresses are inaccessible, or any other issues occur.
- :feature:`schedule,637` pretalx will now display the schedule wider the more rooms are present, starting at four rooms and reaching maximum browser width for six rooms, to make schedules look less cramped and more readable.
- :feature:`cfp,620` Speakers can’t invite other speakers any longer after the CfP is over.
- :announcement:`admin,606` Our documentation now explains which parts of pretalx to back up.
- :feature:`orga:schedule,486` In the schedule editor, the room names and the current date are now fixed to the top when scrolling down.
- :bug:`api,618` Fix a bug where some fields in the schedule XML export were rendered without their timezone offset (only day definitions, not the talk times).
- :feature:`orga:submission,532` Add a field for notes of the organisers for their own use which is not visible to the public and the speakers.
- :feature:`orga:review` Reviewers are now shown a progress bar when going through submissions.
- :feature:`schedule,570` Submissions can now be scheduled multiple times, e.g. if a workshop will be held twice.
- :bug:`orga:schedule` Changing the order of rooms made the schedule break.
- :feature:`orga:review,433` Organisers can now view all reviews, except for their own submissions.
- :feature:`orga,589` Before setting a new custom domain for an event, pretalx now checks if the domain has any DNS records.
- :bug:`cfp` A dependency of ours introduced an XSS vulnerability, which organisers could use to execute JavaScript during the CfP workflow of speakers via question texts. We have added a fix against this behaviour, and submitted a report including a patch to the upstream library. To prevent issues like this one in the future, we have moved all remaining JavaScript sources to files, and set the according CSP header, so that execution of inline JavaScript will be disabled.
- :feature:`cfp,364` Speakers can now invite a co-speaker while in the submission process.
- :feature:`schedule,62` Exporters can now opt in to show a QR code to their location. The XML and iCal exporters show a QR code linking their location by default.
- :feature:`orga:schedule,477` If you only noticed after releasing your schedule that you wanted to changes something in your speaker notifications, you can now generate those emails again from the schedule editor actions menu.
- :bug:`orga:email,479` When telling speakers about their scheduled or rescheduled slots, a hidden mail template was used instead of the actual template visible to the organiser.
- :feature:`cfp,563` For later reference, the full submission is included in the confirmation mail sent to the speaker.
- :bug:`orga:speaker,571` When adding a submission as organiser, pretalx did not validate the speaker email address and then tried to send them an email regardless of its validity.
- :feature:`schedule,403` Organisers can now choose question answers by speakers to be published on the talk/speaker pages. This setting cannot be changed on once the question has been answered, to make sure that speakers are informed about this.
- :feature:`orga:review` Reviewer teams can now be restricted to one or multiple tracks. Reviewers will only see submissions and reviews from these tracks.
- :feature:`orga` Teams settings are now located exclusively at the organiser level. The navigation entry in the event sidebar will take you there directly.
- :feature:`cfp,523` If you use tracks, you can now choose to make questions available only to submissions on certain tracks.
- :feature:`orga:speaker,459` The speaker page in the organiser backend now has a direct link to send an email to that speaker.
- :feature:`orga:review,457` You can now order submissions by the number of reviews they have received on the review page.
- :feature:`orga:email,566` The Reply-To field now permits multiple email addresses.
- :bug:`orga,579` When organisers changed the event time frame, already submitted availabilities would have to be changed upon new submission.
- :feature:`cfp,577` You can now decide if text lengths should be counted in words or in characters when restricting how long they should be.
- :bug:`orga:schedule,587` pretalx did not automatically update a talk’s duration when it was changed via the submission type or directly. It was only changed when you moved the talk in the schedule editor.
- :bug:`cfp,594` pretalx did not display speaker availabilities during submission, even when they were required, breaking submission workflows.
- :feature:`orga:review,346` Due to the generous sponsorship of JuliaCon, pretalx is now capable of blind reviews, i.e. making sure that reviewers cannot see speaker names.
- :feature:`orga` The organiser area has now additional, event specific login pages (at ``/orga/event/<slug>/login/``) which redirect by default to the event dashboard, and appear with the colour and logo of the event in question.
- :feature:`orga:review` The review settings have moved from the CfP page to their own settings page.
- :feature:`orga` You can now decide to add the ``robots=noindex`` meta tag to prevent bots from crawling your event pages.
- :feature:`dev` Plugin developers can now use the ``is_available`` hook to decide if their plugin should be shown on a per-event basis.
- :bug:`orga:speaker` Speaker without an avatar and with gravatar disabled had a broken avatar-image in the speaker’s view in the organiser backend.
- :bug:`schedule` The visual representation of a speaker’s avatar is now consistent across all image-sizes and bio-texts.
- :bug:`cfp,583` When signing up with an email address with upper case letters included, pretalx only allowed to log in with a lower-cased email address.
- :bug:`orga:speaker,572` People who had only deleted submissions in an event were still shown in the submitter list, which was unexpected and was since fixed.
- :feature:`lang` If only one conference language is available, pretalx does not as speakers to choose it from a drop-down, as this behaviour is rather silly.
- :announcement:`admin` pretalx does not run ``regenerate_css`` on startup automatically any longer. This reduces startup times. If for any reason an event does not look as it should, you can fix it by running ``python -m pretalx regenerate_css``. You will also need to execute this command on updates from now on.
- :feature:`orga:schedule` You can now decide if you want to notify speakers about their changed talks when releasing a new schedule.
- :announcement:`admin` To help make other pretalx installations more secure, we have updated our proposed nginx configuration to include an attachment header for all files under /media, to prevent user uploaded data to be delivered directly to other users. If you host a pretalx instance, please make use of this option.
- :feature:`orga` Since SVG files are nearly impossible to sanitise, pretalx has given up trying, and will no longer accept SVG files as image uploads.
- :bug:`schedule` The iCal export for speakers who had both scheduled and not-yet-scheduled talks was broken.
- :feature:`orga:speaker,559` Organisers can download a list of speakers as a CSV file.
- :announcement:`admin` A couple of URLs now end in a trailing slash where they did not before – you will be automatically redirected, so you don’t have to worry about it unless you integrate pretalx somewhere without following redirects.
- :feature:`schedule` You can set the URL of your static HTML export, if you’re using one, and it will be used when generating absolute URLs, e.g. in exports or emails.
- :release:`0.9.0 <2018-12-21>`
- :feature:`-` pretalx can now group talks in tracks. Each talk can be assigned a track (either by the submitter, or by the organiser). Tracks will be displayed in configurable colours in the public schedule. The feature is entirely optional, and you can continue using pretalx without tracks without any problem.
- :feature:`-` We tuned pretalx performance to be faster when showing the schedules of large conferences with several hundreds of talks.
- :feature:`538` The sneak peek view will only feature talks that have been accepted.
- :feature:`440` Organisers can now follow an RSS feed to see new submissions – you’ll have to provide your authentication token in the RSS request header to authenticate.
- :feature:`-` You can now set the default pretalx system wide time zone and locale (defaulting to ``UTC`` and English).
- :bug:`544` Organisers could see the titles of speaker information notes of all events, not just the currently active one (they could not see the details or edit them).
- :feature:`504` The schedule page is now better printable.
- :bug:`-` A `bug <https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/4878>` in celery could make running pretalx with asynchronous workers impossible. We have pinned an earlier celery version that does not show this problem.
- :announcement:`-` A new pretalx plugin adds media.ccc.de as a recording provider – this plugin replaces the previously inbuilt capacity of pretalx to provide recording iframes. (This functionality was never directly exposed and only accessible via the pretalx shell. It is now deprecated and will be removed in a later version.)
- :feature:`-` Plugins can now provide recording iframes (via the new ``register_recording_provider`` signal and other helpers).
- :feature:`-` The new ``nav_event_settings`` plugin signal allows plugins to integrate their own settings pages next to the pretalx core pages.
- :feature:`-` pretalx now presents a colour picker for your event primary colour, including a hint on colour suitability.
- :feature:`-` The new `/api/me` endpoint shows name, email address, locale, and timezone of the logged in user.
- :feature:`-` The ``nav_event`` plugin signal has changed to expect a list instead of a dictionary response. The dictionary response will be supported for one more version, and raises a deprecation warning.
- :feature:`-` The API now provides a ``/rooms`` endpoint.
- :feature:`530` The API now provides a ``/reviews`` endpoint.
- :bug:`529` When trying to review their own submission, a user would see a 404 not found error instead of an explanation that this was a forbidden action.
- :bug:`-` The password reset form told users if they had already tried to reset their password in the last 24 hours. While this is helpful, it also allows user discovery via password reset. Instead, the user now sees a more generic message.
- :feature:`-` While filling out the submission form wizard, submitters see a top bar telling them where they are in the submission process.
- :bug:`-` The event dashboard showed a wrong countdown towards the CfP end while the CfP end was between three and one day away.
- :feature:`-` The new event drop-down helps you find your event, even if you have access to many events.
- :bug:`-` The organiser login page did not strip white-space from login credentials.
- :bug:`524` Review settings contained the setting "Force data entry" twice, referring to the score and text, respectively.
- :bug:`522` If a speaker did not check a mandatory checkbox, they could not submit the form (as intended), but could see no feedback explaining the issue.
- :feature:`-` The ``rebuild`` command now comes with a lot more build output for ease of debugging. You can disable the build output with the new ``--silent/-s`` flag.
- :feature:`476` Administrators can now delete both events and organisers.
- :feature:`493` Speaker email addresses are now available via the API for users with access permissions.
- :bug:`515` Under rare circumstances, the pretalx database could reach a state pretalx could not cope with due to duplicate schedule versions.
- :feature:`512` You can now configure if speakers should provide their availability during talk submission.
- :announcement:`admin` Due to an updated Django version, pretalx has dropped support for PostgreSQL 9.3 and MySQL 5.5.
- :release:`0.8.0 <2018-09-23>`
- :bug:`-` When a user removed a submission containing an answered choice question, pretalx removed the selected answer option, too.
- :bug:`501` When a speaker held more than two talks, their related talks did not show up.
- :bug:`505` Custom CSS may now also include media queries.
- :bug:`500` Display of times could be off in the static HTML export.
- :announcement:`-` The URLs for schedule exports have changed from /my-event/schedule/export?exporter=exporter-name to /my-event/schedule/export/exporter-name – if you have hard-coded links to schedule exporters, please update them accordingly.
- :feature:`213` A human-readable time until the CfP closes now shows up next to the end time.
- :bug:`503` Not all current TLDs did end up included as URLs when processing markdown input to build links.

- :feature:`492` In exports, HTTP ETags are now supported to allow for more aggressive caching on clients.
- :bug:`-` If a review question was mandatory while submission questions were active, they would block the submission process.
- :feature:`-` Organisers can now also reset the password for the speakers they have access to.
- :bug:`488` The HTML export contained media files (not other content) from all conferences on an instance, instead of the exported conference.
- :feature:`-` Present a public list of talks and a list of speakers.
- :bug:`478` The behaviour of pressing enter in multi-step forms was not intuitive in some places.
- :feature:`-` The submission list now includes a graph of submissions over time.
- :feature:`-` You can now see the sneak peek / is_featured flag in the submissions and talk API endpoints.
- :feature:`-` You can now use your authentication token to access all pages you have access to, as you already could for the API. This makes integration of exports much easier.
- :announcement:`admin` All manage commands available in pretalx are now included in the documentation.
- :feature:`240` When using paper cards to build a schedule, each card comes with a QR code link to a quick scheduling form for that submission.
- :feature:`-` You can now see warnings and what the public changelog will look like before releasing a new schedule.
- :feature:`214` The schedule editor shows warnings on scheduling conflicts, including live feedback on where you can schedule a talk.
- :feature:`474` The review dashboard now features the same search and filter options as the submission list.
- :bug:`473` Following the revamp of team permissions, override votes were missing from the settings. We re-introduced the settings, and improved the general handling of override votes.
- :announcement:`admin` pretalx now does not support usernames any longer – as all users had to have email addresses already, you will now have to provide an email address to log in. This may confuse users – as an administrator, you can look up users’ email addresses if they don’t remember them, or change them, if necessary.
- :bug:`-` You could make questions inactive, but not delete them.
- :feature:`408` You can now add length restrictions to abstracts, descriptions, speaker biographies, and all text-based questions.
- :feature:`-` When linking to a talk on social media, those pages will show the talk image.

- :feature:`149` Allow to order questions manually.
- :feature:`dev` We now have tests to make sure all config options and plugin hooks are part of our documentation.
- :feature:`-` Instead of setting a flag somewhere, pretalx now has an explicit "go live" button. Plugins can listen to the corresponding signal (please refer to the plugin documentation for further information).

- :feature:`-` Schedules now feature a sidebar navigation to jump directly to a selected day.
- :feature:`-` Allow organisers to configure which of the default CfP fields to request and require. Please check your settings after updating, as the migration is not guaranteed to work as expected.

- :feature:`415` Allow organisers to trigger a password reset for team members.
- :bug:`451` Don’t crash during ``pretalx init`` if no conference organiser slug is present.
- :release:`0.7.1 <2018-06-19>`
- :bug:`-` The new read-only links for submissions received the same secret token when migrating the database. pretalx leaked no data, as this made using the read-only links impossible. When upgrading to the next release, all read-only link addresses will be reset.
- :bug:`-` A one-character-oversight led to issues with the new navigation search with certain user permissions.
- :release:`0.7.0 <2018-06-19>`
- :feature:`430` To maintain compatibility with frab XML exports, the schedule XML export now contains a ``<url>`` tag.
- :bug:`-` When trying to register a user with a nick that already existed in a different capitalisation, pretalx failed to show a clear error message.

- :bug:`444` If two organisers set a submission to “accepted” at the same time, two acceptance emails would show up in the outbox.
- :bug:`-` Removing a speaker from a submission could be impossible if their nick contained special characters.
- :feature:`-` Submitters can share a submission via a read-only link.
- :feature:`-` Organisers can configure a list of talks as "sneak peek" before they release the first schedule.
- :bug:`446` If an event had a custom domain configured, absolute URLs would still use the instance’s default domain.
- :bug:`441` The "Mark speaker arrived" button is now visible during and slightly before the event, but not during other times.
