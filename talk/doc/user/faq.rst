**We run into issues when using Gmail.** In Google’s eyes, pretalx is a `less
secure app`_, which you’ll have to grant special access. Even then, Gmail is
known to unexpectedly block your SMTP connection with unhelpful error messages
if you use it to send out too many emails in bulk (e.g. all rejections for a
conference) even on GSuite, so using Gmail for transactional email is a bad
idea.
