"""Django tries to be helpful by suggesting to run "makemigrations" in
alarmingly red font on every "migrate" run.

Since pretalx migrations are most often run by pretalx users, that is â€“
administrators, this is dangerous advice. Running "makemigrations" on a
project that you intend to continue to install from PyPI will lead to no
end of headaches, so by this very dirty hack, we're removing the
warnigns from user-facing output.
