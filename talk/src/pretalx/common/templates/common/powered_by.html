    Hi, there!

    You have found the place that will allow you to remove or change the link to pretalx from all
    event websites. Consider, though: please don’t?

    Building pretalx has taken a ton of time and work and dedication – all of it right in the open
    for people to see and to use. I’m busy adding new features all the time, and on the side I
    take care of the boring-but-vital maintenance work. Despite being free, pretalx plays in the
    same league as commercial platforms – or you probably wouldn’t be here, setting it up, right?

    I only make money from pretalx when people buy support contracts or use the hosting platform at
    https://pretalx.com. Now, this isn’t meant to be a money grab: I hope our installation docs and
    open approach make it clear that I want people to run their own instances! But a healthy project
    needs people to survive, and if you patch out the link to the project, those people – prospective
    contributors or customers – won’t find us. Without contributors and users and, yes, customers,
    pretalx will be less maintained and ultimately less useful to you.

    So, if you’re set on editing this file: Please leave our link in. Re-style it, re-word it, put
    your own link next to it – but please do me, and pretalx, and ultimately yourself, the favour of
    not hiding us.

    Thank you ❤,
    Tobias

    P.S.: If you find yourself interested in a support contract or paid feature development after all,
    you can reach me at sales@pretalx.com.
