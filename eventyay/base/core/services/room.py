    # either reconnects automatically or the user will attempt a reconnect themselves through a page reload,

    # the end to "now".

    # open in browser A and then opens the same room in browser B, this will set the ``end`` for the session
    # in browser A, even though it's already running. It doesn't matter, though! First, for all our statistics
    # we only count unique users and the result "this user was present at the time" is still correct. Second,
    # the way ``end_view`` is implemented, the session from browser A will still be corrected with the accurate
