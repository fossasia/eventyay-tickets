            # RAM) on the server. Then, we model an additional cost of 10 * video_senders * video_recipients
            # as well as a cost of 1 * audio_senders * audio_recipients. This follows the bandwidth estimation given
            # at https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/support/faq.html#bandwidth-requirements and we hope that other resources
            # (CPU) are roughly linear to the same values.
